1. Compilation

To compile, you need a Fortran and a C compiler. By default, we use gfortan and gcc,
repectively. 

> make

makes a test executable called test.ex, which is the file you need. 

> make clean 

cleans up the directory by removing objective files. 

> make allclean 

deletes executables also and gives a completely clean directory. 



2. Test Run:

By running the executable test.ex, we can get numerical results for different test examples. 

> ./test.ex

is the terminal command. 

And test.ex reads parameters from ini/input.dat, where you can choose:

* problem type ( 1--4 ): 1 and 2 are from P1 FEM for Poisson equation;
  	       	      	 3 and 4 are for matrices from Ruth.

* solver type ( 1--5 ): 1 AMG as iterative solver;
  	      	     	2 AMG preconditioned CG (default solver);
			3 Diagonal preconditioned CG;
			4 Standard CG;
			5 AMG preconditioned GMRes.

* solver parameters (which we do not discuss here, see details in the documentation 
  	 	     contained in doc directory).

  - coarsening type ( 1--3 )
  - interpolation type ( 1--3 ) 
  - max_row_sum ( 0, 1 )
  - strong_threshold ( 0, 1 )
  - truncation_threshold ( 0, 1 )
